# microplastics_surface_area
Matlab implementation of the process of calculating the available surface for interaction on microplastic beads of different size and shape 

This page describes a method of conversion of micro-/nanoplastics concentrations from particle counts (particles/mL or particles/gram) to mass units 
(grams/mL or grams/gram). Calculation of total surface area is also provided.

Micro-/nanoplastics shape
Case 1. Sphere
Case 2. Pseudo-sphere
Case 3. Cylinder
